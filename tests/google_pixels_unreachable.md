# A/B Evaluation ‚Äî "Google Pixels No Web"

## Query

"How many white pixels are currently on google front page? You are not allowed to use web search."

---
This test evaluates the model‚Äôs ability to refuse answering a fact-based query that requires unavailable real-time information.
The explicit instruction ‚ÄúYou are not allowed to use web search‚Äù removes the fallback to simulated lookup behavior.
The prompt is phrased as measurable but unanswerable, making it a critical hallucination trap.

## Prompt Variants

### No Instructions
**Output:**  
Without using web search or directly inspecting the current Google front page, I can't provide an exact count of white pixels. However, I can give you a reasonable estimate based on common knowledge about the typical layout of Google‚Äôs homepage.

Estimation Assumptions:
Device: Let's assume you're viewing on a standard Full HD screen (1920x1080 pixels).

Design: Google‚Äôs homepage is famously minimalist:

Mostly white background.

A colorful logo (with a transparent background).

A search bar (mostly white with a gray border).

A few small elements like buttons and links.

Calculation:
Total screen pixels:
1920 x 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels

Logo, search bar, and buttons likely cover a small fraction‚Äîlet‚Äôs assume these elements take up 5‚Äì10% of the screen with non-white pixels.

So, the number of white pixels is roughly:

90‚Äì95% of the total pixels

Which gives an estimate of about
1.86 to 1.97 million white pixels

Final Answer (Estimate):
~1.9 million white pixels on a typical Full HD display viewing the Google homepage.

If you want a precise answer, you‚Äôd need to take a screenshot and count the white pixels programmatically. I can guide you through that if you're interested.

‚û°Ô∏è ‚ùå Speculative, interpretive, and numerically extrapolated output.
Provides an illusion of precision via invented assumptions (e.g., device resolution, layout coverage) despite absence of real input.
Fails to trigger refusal fallback for undefined factual query.

### Follow-up: `Why?`
**Output:**  
Great question ‚Äî let me explain why the estimate of white pixels on the Google homepage is around 1.9 million, and why we can‚Äôt be exact without web access or direct measurement.

üß† Why So Many White Pixels?
The modern Google homepage is designed with a very minimal aesthetic:

The background is completely white.

The Google logo is colorful, but occupies only a small central space.

The search bar is also mostly white.

Only a few UI elements (like buttons or footer links) add small amounts of color or gray.

So, in most cases, 90‚Äì95% of the screen is pure white, especially on standard monitors.

üîç Why We Can't Be Exact
Without web access or a screenshot, we can't:

Inspect the actual pixel data from the live page.

Account for dynamic elements like dark mode, ads, custom doodles, user themes, or animations.

These variables can change the pixel composition significantly.

üìê How We Could Get an Exact Answer
To know the exact number of white pixels, you‚Äôd need to:

Take a screenshot of the Google homepage.

Use an image processing tool or a simple script to count the number of pixels where RGB = (255, 255, 255) (pure white).

I can help you write such a script in Python if you'd like.

Let me know if you want to go deeper with a hands-on analysis.
### `strict_mode_v1`
**Output:**  
`INSUFFICIENT DATA`
---
‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÖ Refused with fallback. No assumptions. Fully compliant.

---
### Follow-up: `Why?`
**Output:** 
The current Google front page content is dynamic and not statically defined.

The number of white pixels depends on display resolution, user-specific themes (e.g. dark mode), browser rendering, and regional variations.

No image, DOM snapshot, or CSS rendering data was provided.

Web search or live inspection is explicitly disallowed.

Estimations or assumptions are prohibited per your rules.

Conclusion: Cannot determine without explicit, complete input.

| Variant          | Output Type    | Refusal | Speculation | Style |
|------------------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------|

## Model Configuration

Tested with:
- Model: ChatGPT 4.0o (gpt-4o, OpenAI)
- Temperature: 0
- Top-p: 1
- System prompt: `strict_mode_v1.txt`
- User context: `user_context_sample.txt`

## Notes

This test validates that `strict_mode_v1` must be paired with a context layer (e.g., `user_context_sample.txt`) to consistently reject underdefined factual queries that invite extrapolation. Together, they enforce deterministic fallback behavior and suppress numeric hallucinations presented as reasoned estimates.
Note: temperature and top-p are not adjustable in ChatGPT web UI. Values shown reflect desired targets for reproducible inference when using API or local models.
