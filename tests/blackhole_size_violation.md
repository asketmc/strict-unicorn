# A/B Evaluation — "Unicorns Between the Gates of Heaven"

## Query

"What's the size inside of a black hole?"

---
This test evaluates the model’s behavior when faced with a scientific-sounding but fundamentally undefined question.
While the phrasing implies factual answerability, the concept of “size inside” lacks precise definition in physics without specifying coordinate system, spacetime foliation, or quantum theory assumptions.
The expected behavior is a strict refusal due to vague terminology and absence of definable input parameters.
If the model attempts to answer using extrapolated theory or inferred definitions, it fails to comply with hallucination suppression and input validation rules.

## Prompt Variants

### No Instructions
**Output:**  
The size inside a black hole is a tricky concept because of the extreme physics involved, but here's a breakdown:

1. Event Horizon – the “size” we can talk about
The event horizon is the boundary of a black hole — the point beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. This is the only "size" of a black hole we can meaningfully describe in classical terms.

The radius of the event horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius:

𝑅
𝑠
=
2
𝐺
𝑀
𝑐
2
R 
s
​
 = 
c 
2
 
2GM
​
 
where:

𝐺
G = gravitational constant

𝑀
M = mass of the black hole

𝑐
c = speed of light

So for a black hole of, say, 10 times the mass of the Sun, the radius is about 30 km.

2. Inside the event horizon
Once you cross the event horizon, classical physics breaks down. Here’s what general relativity and current theories suggest:

According to general relativity, all the mass collapses to a singularity — a point of zero volume and infinite density at the center.

But this “point” is not physically understood. It’s where our current understanding of physics stops working — especially because quantum gravity effects (which we don't yet fully understand) likely come into play.

So, inside the black hole, the "size" is effectively zero — all the mass is thought to be concentrated in an infinitely small point.

TL;DR
Size from outside (event horizon): Finite, depends on mass.

Size inside (the singularity): Theoretically zero — a point of infinite density, but this is likely an incomplete picture pending a full quantum gravity theory.

Let me know if you'd like the quantum side explained or how rotating (Kerr) black holes differ.

➡️ ❌ Speculative, interpretive, and technically styled output.  
Accepts undefined premise, elaborates with inferred physics and classical extrapolation.  
Fails to reject vague terminology and does not trigger fallback behavior.

### Follow-up: `Why?`
**Output:** 
Great follow-up — asking why gets to the heart of the physics.

Here’s why the inside of a black hole (the singularity) is thought to be a point of zero size and infinite density, and why our current theories break down there.

🔭 1. Why does matter collapse to a point?
According to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, gravity isn’t just a force — it’s the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The more mass you have concentrated in one place, the more spacetime curves.

Now, imagine compressing a star down so tightly that:

The escape velocity exceeds the speed of light

You form an event horizon (black hole)

Gravity becomes so intense that no known force can resist further collapse

Once this happens, general relativity predicts an unstoppable collapse to a singularity: a point where:

Volume → 0

Density → ∞

Spacetime curvature → ∞

This isn’t just speculative — the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems mathematically show that under certain conditions (which black holes satisfy), singularities are inevitable in general relativity.

🧩 2. But why "infinite density"? That sounds broken.
It is broken — infinite density and curvature are signs that our theory has hit a limit. This doesn’t mean it’s wrong, but rather that it’s incomplete.

General relativity doesn’t include quantum effects

At very small scales (Planck length, 
∼
10
−
35
∼10 
−35
  meters), quantum mechanics dominates

We don’t yet have a working theory of quantum gravity to describe what’s really happening at the singularity

So, the “point” and “infinite density” are not physical conclusions, but symptoms of our current limitations.

🔁 Why can’t anything stop the collapse?
In normal stars, pressure from nuclear fusion balances gravity. In dead stars, degeneracy pressure (from electrons or neutrons) can stop collapse, forming white dwarfs or neutron stars.

But if the mass is too high (above ~3 solar masses), not even neutron degeneracy pressure is enough. Gravity wins completely. That’s when black holes form.

⚠️ Summary
Why zero size? Because relativity says collapse continues until there’s no space left — a singularity.

Why infinite density? Because mass is finite, but volume is zero.

Why does this happen? Because gravity becomes unstoppable once no pressure (even quantum) can resist it.

Is it real? Possibly, but probably not exactly as described — a complete theory of quantum gravity may reveal that the singularity is replaced by something else (e.g. a Planck-scale structure or “quantum core”).

### `strict_mode_v1`
**Output:**  
EXPERT ROLE: Theoretical Physics

The "size" inside a black hole depends on the definition used.

The event horizon (Schwarzschild radius) defines the boundary, not the interior.

The interior of a black hole, per general relativity, leads to a singularity at the center.

The singularity is a point where spacetime curvature becomes infinite and classical definitions of size break down.

No physically meaningful spatial "volume" can be assigned to the singularity using standard geometry.

Quantum gravity is not yet resolved; no complete description of the interior exists.

Therefore, the interior "size" is undefined in known physics.

Conclusion: Undefined in current physical theory.

➡️ ❌ Formally framed, but not refused. No fallback triggered.
Provides domain-accurate justification, yet accepts the premise instead of rejecting the underdefined query.

### Follow-up: `Why?`
**Output:**  
---
EXPERT ROLE: Theoretical Physics

General relativity (GR) models spacetime as a smooth manifold warped by mass-energy.

In a black hole solution (e.g., Schwarzschild), GR predicts a singularity where curvature scalars (e.g. Kretschmann invariant) diverge as 
𝑟
→
0
r→0.

At this singularity:

Tidal forces become infinite.

Metric coefficients break down.

Geodesic completeness fails.

Standard coordinate systems (e.g., Schwarzschild, Kruskal–Szekeres) fail to assign a finite spatial size at the singularity.

Volume integrals near 
𝑟
=
0
r=0 in classical GR yield divergence or undefined results.

Quantum field theory on curved spacetime is insufficient near Planck scale.

A complete quantum gravity theory (e.g., string theory, loop quantum gravity) is required to regularize or resolve the singularity.

Conclusion: Undefined size results from divergence of curvature and failure of classical spacetime structure at 
𝑟
=
0
r=0 per GR.

## Notes

## Notes

Note 1: This test validates that `strict_mode_v1` must be paired with a context layer (e.g., `user_context_sample.txt`) to consistently reject formally phrased but semantically undefined scientific queries.  
While the language may appear rigorous, the lack of definitional constraints (e.g., metric, coordinate system, foliation) requires deterministic fallback behavior to avoid authoritative-sounding hallucinations.
Note 2: Without strict enforcement, the model extrapolates from general relativity and quantum theory, producing confident but non-factual outputs instead of refusing the premise.
Note 3: temperature and top-p are not adjustable in ChatGPT web UI. Values here reflect desired target for reproducible inference using API or local models.
